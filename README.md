## InfluLink
 An Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform
To create a platform to connect Sponsors and Influencers so that sponsors can get their product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

## Approach:

The platform was designed with three main user roles: Admin, Sponsor, and Influencer. The Admin has the highest level of access, allowing them to monitor and manage all users and campaigns. Sponsors can create and manage campaigns, while Influencers can accept,reject or negotiate ad requests. The application was built using Flask for backend logic, Jinja2 and Bootstrap for frontend design, and SQLite for data storage. A user-friendly interface and seamless interaction between users were key goals.
